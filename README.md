# 🐦 Bird Detection using YOLOv8 + ResNet-50 Refinement

This project implements a deep learning–based real-time bird detection system designed for agricultural field surveillance. It uses a two-stage pipeline where YOLOv8 performs fast object detection and a ResNet-50 classifier refines detections to remove false positives such as leaves, insects, shadows, and branches.

It provides a complete pipeline—from dataset preparation and model training to inference and deployment via a Flask web application.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

🔗 **Bird Detection Dataset (YOLOv8 + ResNet-50)**  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khanamer/bird-detection-dataset

The datasets used in this project are not included in the repository and are ignored using `.gitignore` to keep the repository lightweight.

### Dataset Structure

data/
- yolo_dataset        (YOLOv8 dataset with bird and no-bird classes)
- yolo_dataset-2      (Additional YOLO dataset)
- crop_dataset        (Cropped patches for ResNet-50 training)
- crop_dataset-2

### Dataset Description

- YOLO datasets contain full images with bounding-box annotations
- Classes include bird and no-bird
- Crop datasets contain small image patches extracted from YOLO detections
- Crop datasets are used to train the ResNet-50 classifier

### Dataset Preparation

Generate crops for classifier training using:

python classifier/prepare_crops.py

## 🧠 Model Architecture

This system combines fast object detection with classification-based refinement.

YOLOv8 (Stage 1 – Detection):
- Detects bird-like objects in images and video frames
- Outputs bounding boxes with confidence scores
- Optimized for real-time performance

ResNet-50 (Stage 2 – Refinement):
- Takes cropped YOLO detections as input
- Classifies each crop as bird or no-bird
- Filters out false positives before final output

Task Type: Real-time object detection with refinement  
Domain: Agricultural field and crop protection monitoring
